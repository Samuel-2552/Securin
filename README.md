# *Securin Round 1*

# Code Explaination:

### *Dice Inputs and Undo Function*
1. Obtain the list of Dice Inputs.
2. Pass the obtained list to the Undo Dice Function.

### *Constraints Definition*
1. Define Constraint 1: Dice A's range is limited to 0 to 4.
2. Define Constraint 2: Dice B's range is from 0 to the maximum of Dice A plus the maximum of Dice B.

### *Probability Calculation*
1. Utilize the probability function to determine the original probability of both dice.
2. Use two nested for loops within the probability function to iterate through all the ranges and calculate the probability of all combinations of the dice.

### *Combinations Calculation*
1. Calculate combinations with repetition based on Constraint 1 list.
2. Calculate combinations without repetition based on Constraint 2 list.

### *Check Function*
1. Create a check function to compare the lists of possibilities obtained from the two previous steps.
2. Compare each probability from the original probability with the lists of possibilities from both Constraint 1 and Constraint 2.
3. Save the appropriate results and construct a list of lists.
4. Return the function once the comparisons are completed.

### *Display Answer*
1. Finally, display the calculated answer, which likely comprises the outcomes or results obtained from the check function.

This step-by-step breakdown illustrates the process involved in handling dice inputs, defining constraints, calculating probabilities, computing combinations, checking against original probabilities, and displaying the resultant answer.
